 BowlingScore
=============

Create a program, which, given a valid sequence of rolls for one line of American Ten-Pin Bowling, produces the total score for the game. Here are some things that the program will not do:
* We will not check for valid rolls.
* We will not check for correct number of rolls and frames.
* We will not provide scores for intermediate frames.

You can find more info on how score is calculated here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring

Some test ideas:
* Gutter game scores zero - When you roll all misses, you get a total score of zero.
* All ones scores 20 - When you knock down one pin with each ball, your total score is 20.
* A spare in the first frame, followed by three pins, followed by all misses scores 16.
* A strike in the first frame, followed by three and then four pins, followed by all misses, scores 24.
* A perfect game (12 strikes) scores 300.
